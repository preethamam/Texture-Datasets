# Texture datasets (Textures-97.1K)
Textures are the naturally occuring feel or apperance of an object or material or substance. Textures can be used to classify the type of materials and more. Deep learning and machine learning-based supervised classification methods requires carefully annotated images for the texture classification. Furthermore, for the synthesis of textural images this datasets can be used. This is a repository of human annotated texture classification datasets of concrete, corrosion, pavement, sand and steel surfaces. I collected these datasets during my Ph.D. days in 2014 by web harvesting.

I thank Shravan Ravi, Vinay Hegde, and Milind Bhat (chronological order) for their efforts in the collection and preparation of the crack and non-crack concrete and pavement surface image database around the University of Southern California (USC) campus at Los Angeles, USA. I thank Dr. Azarang Golmohammadi who web harvested cracks images of concrete (407 numbers), corrosion, pavement (28 numbers), sand, and steel images.  In addition, I thank Ajay Kumar V. for his conscientious efforts in creating concrete and pavement classification annotations.
